# Random Values

## Introduction

**Random values** are widely used in programming for various applications such as simulations, games, security, and testing. Randomness introduces variability and helps create unpredictable outcomes.

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. **Understand what random values are.**
2. **Write pseudocode using random value generation.**
3. **Apply random values in practical scenarios.**

## **<span style="color:blue">Key Concepts</span>**

1. `Random Values`: Values generated in such a way that each value within a specified range has an equal chance of being selected.
2. `Random Number Generators (RNGs)`: Algorithms or functions that produce random values.

## Example Syntax (College Board Pseudo code)

College Board pseudocode uses the following structure for generating random values:

```plaintext
RANDOM(a, b)

Where a and b are the lower and upper bounds of the range (inclusive).

<span style="color:blue">Example 1: Rolling a Die</span>
Pseudocode
Let's write pseudocode to simulate rolling a six-sided die:
result ← RANDOM(1, 6)
DISPLAY result

<span style="color:blue">Example 2: Random Decision Making</span>
Pseudocode
Let's consider a scenario where we make a random decision between "yes" and "no":
decision ← RANDOM(1, 2)
IF decision = 1
{
    DISPLAY "Yes"
}
ELSE
{
    DISPLAY "No"
}

## Python
Here is the equivalent Python code:




```python
import random

decision = random.randint(1, 2)
if decision == 1:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")

```

    No


<span style="color:blue">Example 3:</span>
Write pseudocode to simulate drawing a random card from a standard deck of 52 cards:

Generate a random number between 1 and 52.
Display the card number.
card ← RANDOM(1, 52)
DISPLAY "Card number: " + card

## Python
Here is the equivalent Python code:




```python
import random

card = random.randint(1, 52)
print("Card number:", card)

```

    Card number: 52


<span style="color:blue">Summary</span>
<span style="background-color:lightgrey">Random values</span> introduce variability and unpredictability into programs, making them essential for various applications. By understanding how to generate and use random values, you can enhance your programs with elements of randomness.




## Hacks
Review each of the sections above and produce ...

- Write pseudocode to simulate flipping a coin 10 times and display the result of each flip.
- Write a python segment to generate a random password of 8 characters, using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits.
